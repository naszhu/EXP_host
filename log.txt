v1:
//The following is a pilot version- V1
//Check consent form tomorrow.
//consent: change you will see a list of words to remember to pictures - checked
///intiial instructions - font became smaller for a line - checked
// disable show correct - checked
//check practice instructions - checked
//add a survey trial to ask if this participant have done task like this before. (from other researchers)

v1.2
/************************************************************************************
* Code version v1.2 - pilot tested 3 participants
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 1. This version added survey questions timeline at the end
* 2. Modified code lline 638:  obj.current_assignmentTypesWithinList = ['A','Cn'].includes(obj.stimulusConditions) ? "T_nontarget" : "T_target"; --> T_target and T_nontarget logic is reverse previously
* 3. Practice test instructions has been changed. (Emphysis only judging CURRENT list to be old)
*

Problem of this version:
1. Forgot to change consent form--the concent form has real big problems, please don't write accuracy stuff in it.
2. Next version could choose to change the way jspsych end when the preload failed. Right now, it is using formal EndExperiment, which gives signal to cognition.run in marking it as finished data, though it shouldn
t. -- This is not super important, doesn't have to be changed.
3. There is a FALSE in testpos_appear2_initial, in final test, has somewhere to be "FALSE", but elsewhere to be number value 0 or 1-20. However, I don't know if changing this is a necessarily a good thing-- 
    If I change this version, then when I am analyzing the data, I need to repatch and replace some of the FALSE into 0 and make some others to be something else, which could create potential confounds.

!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHANGES SUMMARY
: big changes are v1 to v1.2; and v1.4 to v1.5

MAIN BUGS:
1. v1-v1.2: in study arr obj obj.current_assignmentTypesWithinList T and F is reversed, which influenced testPos_appear1_initial
doesn influence testPos_appear0_initial for study items

2. v1.4 to v1.5: currAssign_nPlusOneTrial wrong , so stimulusConditionName_nPlusOneTrial wrong for intial&final test didn't +1 for Cn and Dn
can't rely on this in analysis, but can use type_comments

3. v1.4 to v1.5: study arr obj  obj_iFinalFoil.listNum_pickedFrom = ilist + 1; influence dfinal test listNum_pickedFrom
